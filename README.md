# MCP Security Governance

**Cloud Security Alliance governance framework for the Model Context Protocol ecosystem. Developing policies, standards, and assessment tools to ensure secure and responsible deployment of MCP servers and AI agent integrations.**

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in AI-to-tool connectivity, enabling large language models to interact with external systems, APIs, and services. As this protocol gains widespread adoption, the need for comprehensive governance frameworks becomes critical to ensure secure, compliant, and responsible deployment across organizations.

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is exploring the development of governance frameworks specifically tailored for the MCP ecosystem. Building on CSA's extensive experience in cloud security governance—including the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), Security Trust Assurance and Risk (STAR) program, and various industry-specific governance frameworks—this initiative would establish the governance foundation for safe MCP adoption.

## Why MCP Governance Matters

The Model Context Protocol introduces unique governance challenges that require specialized frameworks:

### Rapid Deployment Reality
- MCP servers are often built and deployed in minutes through AI-generated code
- Traditional governance processes assume longer development cycles and human review
- Organizations need frameworks that can govern "prompt-driven infrastructure"

### Unique Risk Profile
- MCP servers can access sensitive systems (email, file systems, databases, APIs)
- AI agents can trigger business-critical actions through MCP integrations
- The protocol's universality creates both opportunities and risks at scale

### Ecosystem Fragmentation
- Hundreds of community-developed MCP servers with varying security postures
- No standardized assessment or certification processes
- Organizations lack tools to evaluate MCP server trustworthiness

## Potential Governance Framework Components

Based on CSA's proven approach to governance framework development, an MCP governance framework would likely include:

### Policy and Standards Framework
- **MCP Security Controls**: Comprehensive control framework for MCP server security
- **Assessment Guidelines**: Standardized evaluation criteria for MCP servers
- **Compliance Mappings**: Alignment with existing regulatory and industry standards
- **Risk Management**: Framework for assessing and managing MCP-related risks

### Assessment and Certification Tools
- **MCP Assessment Questionnaire**: Standardized evaluation tool for MCP servers
- **Certification Levels**: Tiered certification program for different risk levels
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Framework for ongoing assessment of deployed MCP servers
- **Vendor Assessment**: Tools for evaluating MCP server providers and maintainers

### Implementation Guidance
- **Deployment Best Practices**: Guidelines for secure MCP server deployment
- **Organization Policies**: Template policies for MCP adoption and management
- **Compliance Guidance**: How to meet regulatory requirements with MCP implementations
- **Risk Assessment**: Methodologies for evaluating MCP-related risks
